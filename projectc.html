                    <h3>Top 10 Website</h3>
                    <p>One of the earliest projects I worked on in my interactive design program was a Top 10 website. I used it as an opportunity to experiment with typography, layout, and playful design elements. Rather than focusing strictly on usability. I based each page on thematic aspects of the shows, making sure each section reflected its unique style and personality.</p>

                    <p>Little research was needed in the making of the designs as I already knew a lot about each show. The main focus I did outside of the final outcome was look for the typefaces used in each shows credits and/or logo. In the future I’d like use my old work as a base to redesign it more like an actual website, including a proper navigation bar at the top, footer at the bottom, and a hero image. Looking back, I really enjoyed the freedom to experiment, even though I can see a lot of flaws with the design, such as the visibility and element sizes. I’d love to explore more projects that let me blend design with personality in this way.</p>

            <h3>Page Layout</h3>
            <p>All of the pages followed a similar layout, with minor changes to each one. Some changes were more experiemental, like the character cards being photographs on the #4 Gravity Falls page.

                Below are some examples of the websites pages</p>
