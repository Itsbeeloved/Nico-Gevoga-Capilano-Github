                    <h3>Website Redesign</h3>
                    <p>This is a project that I think best demonstrates my knowledge of user-focused design. A lot of what we focused on in my program centred around user research and different ways to measure how a user would interact with a website. The Granville Island website was a perfect case study for this, as it serves both locals and tourists.</p>

                    <p>Being local to Vancouver, this project was especially interesting for me as I am a member of the audience that it’s aiming to attract. My approach involved analyzing the existing site, identifying pain points, and redesigning to improve visual appeal and simplicity. I focused a lot on improving the information hierarchy and simplicity as I’d imagine being a tourist trying to navigate a new place would be overwhelming enough on it’s own. There was also a lot of feedback on the websites old colours being childish, so when I did my redesign I used less colours  and more engaging images to keep the fun and vibrant feel that Granville island has.</p>

            <h3>Nourish BC</h3>
            <p>This project really reinforced the importance of balancing functionality with aesthetics, ensuring that the design was highly usable. I also found that this was one of the assignments where I was able to grasp the usefulness of user journey maps, even though it’s not my favourite part of interactive design, I feel it’s the area I’ve improved in most. In the future I hope that I get more assignments to improve visual elements too!

            Below are some examples of the websites homepage and a user journey map I made.</p>
