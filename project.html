                    <h3>Website Redesign</h3>
                    <p>One of the school projects we got was to redesign an  an existing social impact organization. I decided to redesigned a Food bank website, focusing on creating a more visually engaging experience. The original site had cluttered navigation, outdated visuals, and overall felt a bit colder than I would have liked it to. A goal I set for myself was to add fun graphic elements because I’d like to focus more on design in the future.</p>

                    <p>I started the process by researching the original website, looking into the brand goals and characters. I built a case as to why it was worth being redesigned, updated the colours, and picked a new name that reflected the brands values. I then made a word mark and created a moodboard to best communicate the feeling I was going for. The last weeks of the project were spent working on the wireframes and mockups for the website. I’m quite proud of what I managed to accomplish for this project. There were a lot of graphic elements that I created and didn’t use, and in the future I would maybe spend less time trying to perfect certain aspects as it slowed down my process more than I would have liked.</p>
