                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm Nico! I’m a 19-year-old student currently studying interactive design at Capilano University's IDEA program. I spend most of my free time drawing and watching shows with my cat. My journey into design started in childhood, as I’ve always loved the arts, but above all, drawing has always been my favourite. In grade 8, I took my first graphic design class and ended up enjoying it so much that I continued taking the class all the way until graduation. Since then, I’ve focused more on branding, typography, and UI/UX. In the future, I plan to further improve my graphic design skills, as that’s what I enjoy most about interactive design.</p>
                
                <p>Recently, I was hired for temporary work at a local product design company, assisting with product photography for their catalog. I’ve also done modelling for them in the past, as well as for another company. One of my favourite projects I’ve worked on was my grade 12 capstone project. A friend and I did a group of people's makeup inspired by drag, took photos of them in various locations, and designed a short magazine to showcase our work. I focused mainly on the makeup and design, creating the magazine layout and graphic elements to match each spread. The goal of the project was to celebrate self-expression and creative freedom.</p>

                <p>I’m currently in school on the Beedie Luminaries scholarship, which is amazing because otherwise, I would have had to work for a few years before affording school. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunities I’ve been given, and I look forward to seeing what else is to come!</p>
